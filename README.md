#### Important commands for Linux:
- check internet connectivity `sudo apt-get update`
- Check internet connectivity `sudo apt-get update`
- Run upgrade `sudeo apt-get upgrade -y`
- Where am i `pwd` give you your current location
-whoami `uname` or `uname -a`
- how to create a file in linux `touch filename`
- how to check file/folder available in current location `ls` or to check all files hidden files as well `ls -a`
- how to navigate to the folder `cd folder-name`
- how to create a folder `mkdir folder-name`
- how to navigate back/out `cd ..` or `cd` enter
- research how to copy file from 1 location to another
- copy test.txt into app folder
- how to navigate between OS and VM `exit` enter
- for admin access `sudo` switch to admin user `sudo su`
- change permission `chmod instructions file-name` i.e `chmod 700 test.text`
- currently running process `top` and `ps aux`
- to remove any process `kill PID` - `kill 7`
- how to delete folder/hidden folder `ls -a` 
- print last 3 lines from test.txt
- print first 3 lines from test.txt
- print last 10 lines from test.txt
- print last line from the test.txt
- research how to use ` | pipe` & `grep` & `sort`
- The Pipe is a command in Linux that lets you use two or more commands such that output of one command serves as input to the next.
- Grep is an essential Linux and Unix command. It is used to search text and strings in a given file.
- SORT command in Linux is used to arrange the record in a specific order according to the option used.
- `ps aux` short list by name
- how to create / run a process in the background and foreground, create / run a process in both areas
- kill the process you created

#### Installation of nginx:
- install `nginx` in our VM
- create a `private-network between local host and VM
- allocate an IP address
- `sudo apt-get install nginx -y`
- how to check a tool/software status in linux `sudo systemtcl status nginx`
- how to restart a process in linux `

- tail -3 test.txt - first 10 lines
- head -3 test.txt - first 3 lines
- tail -10 test.txt - last 3 lines
- tails test.txt - last 10 lines
- tails -1 test.txt - last line

# Task
- What is virtualisation & benefits of it?
- Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system. This enables IT organizations to run more than one virtual system – and multiple operating systems and applications – on a single server. The resulting benefits include economies of scale and greater efficiency.
- What is dev env?
- A development environment in software and web development is a workspace for developers to make changes without breaking anything in a live environment.
- What is vagrant?
- Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time
- What is a virtual box?
- VirtualBox is open-source software for virtualizing the x86 computing architecture. It acts as a hypervisor, creating a VM (virtual machine) where the user can run another OS (operating system).
